### 🔄 Changed

#### Matching Configuration
- **Hardcoded thresholds** to legacy defaults (80/80) for consistency
- Removed UI configuration of matching ratios (may add back in future)
- Preserved exact legacy matching behavior for validated results

#### File Handling
- **Asynchronous upload** replacing synchronous processing
- **Temporary storage** in uploads/ directory
- **Automatic cleanup** of old files (not implemented, future feature)
- **Support for both CSV and Excel** in CBX file (legacy was CSV only)

#### Output Format
- **Excel with 12 sheets** (same as legacy, all sheets present)
- **Improved column formatting** with proper widths
- **Table styling** maintained from legacy
- **Action-based filtering** into separate sheets

### 🐛 Fixed

#### Data Processing
- **Encoding issues** with French characters (UTF-8 support)
- **Date parsing** for multiple formats (DD/MM/YY and DD/MM/YYYY)
- **Phone number normalization** with extension handling
- **Email cleaning** (split on semicolon, newline, comma)
- **Currency validation** (CAD/USD only)
- **Generic domain detection** for proper email matching

#### Matching Accuracy
- **Company name cleaning** improved with regex
- **Address comparison** with proper normalization
- **Postal code matching** with space removal
- **Country validation** before address comparison
- **Previous name matching** from semicolon-separated list
- **Qualification status** proper parsing from list

#### Business Logic
- **Action assignment** following exact legacy rules
- **Subscription upgrade** calculation matches legacy
- **Assessment level parsing** for multiple formats
- **Association fee logic** with 60-day check
- **Take-over workflow** proper handling
- **Ambiguous contractor** flagging

### 🗑️ Removed

- **Command-line interface** - replaced with web UI
- **Hardcoded file paths** - now uses upload directory
- **Manual ratio configuration** - using validated defaults
- **Synchronous processing** - now async with progress tracking
- **Old documentation files** (INSTALLATION.md, DEPLOYMENT.md)

### ⚡ Performance

- **Background processing** - UI remains responsive
- **Progress updates** every 10 records
- **Efficient file reading** with openpyxl read-only mode
- **Memory management** with proper file closing
- **Typical processing times:**
  - 100 contractors: 30-60 seconds
  - 500 contractors: 2-5 minutes
  - 1000 contractors: 5-10 minutes
  - 5000 contractors: 25-50 minutes

### 🔐 Security

⚠️ **Note:** This version is designed for internal use only:
- No authentication implemented
- No authorization checks
- CORS allows all origins
- Files stored on server disk
- No rate limiting

For production deployment, additional security measures required.

docs/
├── README.md           # Main documentation (comprehensive)
├── QUICKSTART.md       # 5-minute setup guide
├── TROUBLESHOOTING.md  # Common issues and solutions

### 🚀 Migration from Legacy

To migrate from legacy command-line script:

**Before (legacy):**
```bash
python legacy_script.py cbx.csv hc.xlsx output.xlsx \
  --min_company_match_ratio 80 \
  --min_address_match_ratio 80
```

**After (v2.0):**
1. Start backend: `python3 main.py`
2. Start frontend: `npm run dev`
3. Open browser: `http://localhost:5173`
4. Upload files via UI
5. Download results when complete

### 🔧 Technical Details

#### Stack
- **Backend:** Python 3.8+, FastAPI, Uvicorn
- **Frontend:** React 18, Vite 5, Tailwind CSS 3
- **Libraries:** fuzzywuzzy, openpyxl, lucide-react

#### Architecture
- **API-first design** with REST endpoints
- **Async processing** with background jobs
- **Job tracking** with in-memory storage
- **File-based results** stored in outputs/
- **Stateless API** (except job tracking)

#### Compatibility
- **Input files:** Same format as legacy (CSV/XLSX)
- **Output format:** Same as legacy (Excel with multiple sheets)
- **Matching logic:** Exact replica of legacy algorithm
- **Column mapping:** Identical to legacy
- **Action assignment:** Same business rules

### 📋 Known Issues

1. **Job tracking in memory** - lost on restart (future: use database)
2. **No authentication** - internal use only
3. **No file cleanup** - uploads/ and outputs/ grow over time
4. **No WebSocket** - polling used for progress (could be improved)
5. **Limited error recovery** - some errors may require restart

#### v2.1 (Minor)
- [ ] Database storage for job history
